## **TokenTeer**
Critical in building unity amongst Singaporeans, volunteering plays a major role in fostering environmental conservation, community development and economic growth. Yet, despite its widespread socio-economic benefits, these opportunities have not been fully capitalized upon. With only a measly 22% citizen volunteerism rate in which a majority are retirees, there requires a call for action to involve the younger generation in such activities. To enhance civic participation, we will integrate gamification into a volunteering platform.
